        Hello guys, who here doesn't know OBS Studio? There are so many Streamers and YouTubers who use this application for recording and creating their content. especially if they want to do live streaming content, they certainly use this application. <br />
        The reason why many people use the OBS Studio application is because the OBS Studio application is 100% free and also opensource, so they don't have to pay quite expensive money to buy this one recording software. Besides being free, OBS Studio also has many features and configurations that you can set to your heart's content, so you can get great recording results and don't even need to re-edit.<br />
        But because this application is classified as too many features, so for those of you who are beginners, you must feel confused about how to set up basics for beginners. So I as an OBS Studio user will give you a basic tutorial for using this application. So yeah, let's go
    </p>
    <h4 class="w3-container w3-center">OBS Studio Home Screen</h4>
    <p class="w3-container w3-justify">
        In the initial view in OBS Studio, we are given several menus and options, such as "scenes", "sources", "audio mixer", "transitions", and "controls". we will discuss one by one.
    </p>
    <h5 class="w3-container">
        1. Scene menu - For Saving any elements <br>
        2. Sources menu - Inserting any elements (such as screen capture, camera, images, etc) <br>
        3. Audio mixer - For adjusting volume and sound from every single elemetns/source <br>
        4. Transitions menu - For adjusting scene transitions. (usually for changing screen mode) <br>
        5. Controls menu - For doing what you will do for all of your setup
    </h5>
    <p class="w3-container w3-justify">
        If you are opened up OBS Studio for the first time, you can not immediately start recording, because you need to add some sources first. You must follow these steps for start capturing your screen
    </p>
    <h5 class="w3-container">
        1. Go to "scenes" menu, then click "add" button <br>
        2. After popup showed up, click "display capture" <br>
        3. Give a name for display capture, and click "OK" <br>
        4. Adjust some options like "capture method", "display", and don't forget to turn on "capture cursor" if you want to show cursor on your capture <br>
        5. Now adjust screen capture on preview tab (on black screen)
    </h5>
    <p class="w3-container w3-justify">
        Lastly, adjust your audio settings such as volume for your mic and desktop audio. if everything is done, click "start recording" and now you can record your entire screen <br>
        for advanced tutorial, you can search in some Internet results because I'm only showing you the basics
